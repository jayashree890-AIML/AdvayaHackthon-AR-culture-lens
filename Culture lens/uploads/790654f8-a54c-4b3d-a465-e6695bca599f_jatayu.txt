The Jatayu Earth’s Center, also known as Jatayu Nature Park or Jatayu Rock, is a unique tourist destination located in Kerala, India.
It is famous for having the world’s largest bird sculpture, which represents Jatayu, a mythical eagle from the Indian epic Ramayana. 
According to the legend, Jatayu tried to rescue Sita when she was being kidnapped by the demon king Ravana, but was defeated and fell to the earth. 
The sculpture stands on the very spot where it is believed Jatayu fell after the battle. The monument was created by filmmaker and sculptor Rajiv Anchal, and it took about 10 years to complete. 
The statue is 200 feet long, 150 feet wide, and 70 feet tall, making it a massive tribute to bravery and sacrifice. Besides the sculpture, the park also offers adventure activities, a cable car ride, and a museum inside the structure.
 The Jatayu Earth’s Center beautifully combines mythology, art, and eco-tourism to honor a heroic character from Indian culture.
